# Student Grading Prediction with Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project uses machine learning to predict student grades based on various performance metrics. The goal is to build an accurate grading model that evaluates student performance and provides predictive insights.

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes various student-related attributes such as attendance, assignment scores, quiz results, and exam scores.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Pre-Processing
- Cleaning and normalizing student performance data.
- Removing irrelevant features that do not contribute to grade prediction.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

### 2. Machine Learning Model
- **Random Forest**: Used for its accuracy and robustness in handling tabular data.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Evaluated for comparison.
- **Neural Networks**: Used to explore deep learning approaches.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, and recall metrics are used for performance evaluation.
- Confusion matrices are generated to assess classification errors.

## Results and Analysis
| Model             | Accuracy |
|------------------|---------|
| Random Forest    | 95.2%   |
| SVM             | 92.8%   |
| Neural Network  | 96.1%   |

The **Neural Network model** showed the highest accuracy in predicting student grades.

## Conclusion
- Machine learning models can effectively predict student grades with high accuracy.
- The **Neural Network model** performed the best in this study.
- Further improvements can be made with more feature engineering and data collection.
